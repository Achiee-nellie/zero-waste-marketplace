Project Summary
Zero Waste Marketplace is a full-stack web application aimed at promoting sustainable consumption by connecting buyers and sellers of zero-waste products. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it supports UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Project Module Description
The project is divided into two main modules:

Backend: Handles the server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions using Node.js and Express.
Frontend: A React-based client that provides an interactive user interface for browsing products, managing user accounts, and completing purchases.
